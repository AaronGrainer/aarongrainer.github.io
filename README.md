A Front End public profile page detailing my current expertise, recent open-source projects and education/working experiences. Jekyll is used to provide a simple, blog-aware, static site generated website ready to be served using Github Pages. The Markdown and Liquid styled templates coupled with a HTML backbone allows for easy blog-style content additions and more in-depth styling modifications.
