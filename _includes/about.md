After graduating from <a href="https://www.nottingham.edu.my" id="linkColor" target="_blank">The University of Nottingham, Malaysia</a> in 2018 with an Mechatronics Engineering degree, I obtained a
doctorate in the beginning of 2017 at <a href="http://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en" id="linkColor" target="_blank">IDLab</a>,
which was supported by a Doctoral Fellowship of the <a href="http://www.fwo.be/en/" id="linkColor" target="_blank">Research
Foundation â€” Flanders (FWO)</a> for fundamental research.
<br><br>
Initially I performed applied research in combinatorial optimization and operations research at the <a
href="http://set.kuleuven.be/codes" id="linkColor" target="_blank">CODeS</a> group, part of <a id="linkColor" target="_blank"
href="http://www.kuleuven.be/english/">KU Leuven, Belgium</a>, in collaboration with <a
href="http://corporate.arcelormittal.com" id="linkColor" target="_blank">ArcelorMittal</a>. Hereafter I worked in the
domain of network science, designing experimental routing strategies for computer networks. Later my interests
shifted to artificial intelligence and machine learning, which became my true passion.
<br><br>
More specifically I focused on combining deep neural networks with structured prediction. During my doctoral
studies, I also acted as a researcher at the R&D institute <a
href="http://www.imec-int.com/en/articles/smart-mobility" id="linkColor" target="_blank">imec</a>, which allowed me to
apply my research to visual perception in <a

id="linkColor" target="_blank">autonomous agricultural vehicles</a>, in collaboration with <a
href="http://www.cnhindustrial.com" id="linkColor" target="_blank">CNH Industrial</a>.
<br><br>
Later as part of my doctoral studies, I investigated exploration strategies for deep reinforcement learning.
During this time, I pursued research both at <a href="https://openai.com/blog/generative-models/"
id="linkColor" target="_blank">OpenAI</a> and at the <a href="http://bair.berkeley.edu/" id="linkColor" target="_blank">Berkeley
Artificial Intelligence Research lab (BAIR)</a>, part of <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu"
id="linkColor" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>, with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/"
id="linkColor" target="_blank">Pieter Abbeel</a>. This latter stay was supported by a Travel Grant of the FWO.
<br><br>
From 2017 to 2018, I was a research scientist at OpenAI in machine learning with a focus on deep reinforcement
learning. I co-organized the Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop at NIPS <a id="linkColor" target="_blank"
href="https://sites.google.com/view/deeprl-symposium-nips2017">2017</a>/<a id="linkColor" target="_blank"
href="https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-workshop-nips-2018">2018</a> and was involved in the Berkeley <a
